This repository contains all my file manipulation Python files. The program downloads photos from Google Photos, manipulates the file names, add folders, move to new folders, and then uploads files to Google Drive. This primarily was a coding practice for me. The major restriction that I had in place for myself is that the program(s) use PySimpleGUI to view photos, file names, and folder names. As of 11/7/2021, the program is in a satisfactory state, as the program does all the things I wanted it to do when I started. There are a few file type additions I will add at some point (.doc/.docx and .xls/.xlsx are the ones that spring to mind) and possibly add a photo rotation tool. The tool even has customization options for changing font/background colors, and will remember the settings for future runs!
