This repository will contain all my file manipulation Python files. The program (once completed) will be able to download files (Google Photos will be the first part for me), manipulate the file names, add folders, rearrange to new folders, and then upload files to somewhere else (Google Drive is my end goal). This is primarily a coding practice for me. The major restriction that I have in place for myself is that the program(s) will be using PySimpleGUI to be able to view photos, file names, and folder names. This restriction is so that if I get my programs to a satisfactory spot, I can share it with my coworkers.
